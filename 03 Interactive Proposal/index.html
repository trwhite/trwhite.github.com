	<h1><img id="sketch" src="Images/sketch.jpg" alt="sketch"/></h1>
	<p id='body1'> So what I'm thinking of doing for my interactive site is an infographic based on the data I collected<br>
	in a previous assignment. It's 146 tweets I catalogued by various properties within each tweet. This<br> 
	information will be broken up into separate pieces and then the user can hover, click, and scroll through. </p>
	<p id='body2'> As for the behavioral portion, it will start with an image at the top. This image will stay still as<br>
	if set behind even when the user scrolls down. The second portion that will be encountered is a box with<br>
	three icons underneath, and an arrow pointing at the icon. When the user clicks an icon, the arrow would<br>
	move over to it, also changing the information in the box to correspond to the icon. Scrolling further<br>
	brings you to the last interactive piece. It's a series of pie charts. Next to them are boxes and information<br>
	that relates to the pieces of the pie, and when you hover over the information, the appropriate pie piece<br>
	will light up. </p>
